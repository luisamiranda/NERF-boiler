# NERF-boiler
Node, Express, React, and Redux boilerplate for use with backend-as-a-service (or when you only need a front end). Also an easy way to test a single component without building a whole project.

# How to use
Clone or download the repo. Run commands in your terminal: `npm install` and then `npm start`.

If you are on a Unix system, this should be all you need to do. If you are on Windows, and the site quits with an error, you may need to edit the `npm start`script in the `package.json` to read:  
Then run the `npm start` command again.

Navigate to `http://localhost:1337/` or if you want to access from a computer other than the one running the program, `http://ThatComputersIPAddress:1337/`.

You're ready to start subbing in your own React components for mine!
